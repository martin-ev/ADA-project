    "Our main goal in this project is to find social and economic world-wide relations of countries based on the state of their agricultural sector, using indicators such as imports, exports, production, self-sufficiency, etc. In order to find such indicators, we would like to use the data from the \"Global Food & Agriculture Statistics\" datasets. First, we would like to produce a map showing which countries \"feed the world\" i.e. which countries are net-exporting food. That map would contain a slider to show how this evolved over the past fifty years. Then we would like to show countrywise the level of food self-sufficiency i.e. the way a country does not need to trade with other ones in order to feed its population. We will also compare it to nations' economic development and see if some correlations can be found. We will visualize our best findings with several interactive maps and plots."

    "\n",
    "- How does the production and consumption of food look like from a geographical point of view ? Which countries are net food exporters or importers? How did this evolve over the last few decades ?\n",
    "- What's the level of self-sufficiency in food production of individual countries and how does this change over time ?\n",
    "- Is there a link between the GDP per capita and the agricultural trade balance ? Are countries that are net exporters or importers richer ? Are self-sufficient countries richer ?\n",
    "- If we find any relations, are they also still valid if we check for specific crops ? Are there some crops that are mostly produced by richer countries, some that are mostly produced by poorer countries?\n"
