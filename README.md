# Who feeds the world ? And does it pay ?

# Abstract
Our main goal in this project is to find social and economics relations in the countries based on the state of their agriculture, i.e. imports, exports, productions, self-sufficiency, etc. In order to do that, we would like to use the data from the "Global Food & Agriculture Statistics" datasets. First, we would like to produce a map showing which countries feed each other. That map would contain a slider to show how this evolved over the past fifty years. Then we would like to show the level of food self-sufficiency. We will also compare it to nations' economic development and see if some correlations can be found. We will visualize our findings with interactive maps and plots. 

# Research questions
We would like to work on the following research questions:
- How does the production and consumption of food look like from a geographical point of view ? Which countries are net food exporters or importers? How does this evolve over the last few decades ? What's the level of self-sufficiency in food production of individual countries and how does this change over time ?
- Is there a link between the GDP per capita and the agricultural trade balance ? Are countries that are net exporters or importers richer ? Are self-sufficient countries richer ? 
- If we find any relations, are they also still valid if we check for specific crops ? Are there some crops that are mostly produced by richer countries, some that are mostly produced by poorer countries?

# Dataset
Our main dataset would be a subset of the "Global Food & Agriculture Statistics" that is found in the proposed datasets list. In this dataset, we have seen that we could work with the import and export quantities per year and per country. We will add information about countries GDP to this database.
