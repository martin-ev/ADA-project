# Who feeds the world ? And does it pay ?

# Abstract
Our main goal in this project is to find social and economics relations in the countries based on the state of their agriculture, i.e. imports, exports, productions, self-sufficiency, etc. In order to do that, we would like to use the data from the "Global Food & Agriculture Statistics" datasets. First, we would like to produce a map showing which countries feed each other. That map would contain a slider to show how this evolved over the past fifty years. Then we would like to show the level of food self-sufficiency. We will also compare it to nations' economic development and see if some correlations can be found.

# Research questions
We would like to work on the following research questions:
- How does the production and consumption of food look like from a geographical point of view ? Which countries are net food exporters or importers? How does this evolve over the last few decades ? Whats the level of self-sufficiency in food production of individual countries?
- Is there a link between the Gross Domestic Product and the trade balnance of agriculture ? Does countries which export more are richer ? What about the price of the food ?
- Does this relation is valid for each kind of crops ? Or are they some luxury crops, expensive and exported by rich countries only ?

# Dataset
Our main dataset would be a subset of the "Global Food & Agriculture Statistics" we have seen in the proposed datasets list. In this dataset, we have seen that we could work with the import and export quantities per year and per country. We would also like to study the price of the food in relation with it.
